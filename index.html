											DC raised and currently Atlanta based, Full Stack Developer, Engineer, Entrepreneur, Investor, and a student of life. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems from University of Maryland Baltimore County(UMBC). For 11 years, I consulted federal agencies
											within Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Labor, on how to implement, manage, and maintain enterprise applications, COTS products, and Data Warehousing & Business Intelligence solutions. During my tenure as a consultant, I held various roles and
											responsibilities, that included; program and project manager, business development consultant, proposal writer, Oracle Federal ERP subject matter expert, and senior business intelligence reports developer to name a few.

											My time at PwC was an incredibly rewarding experience that shaped me into the well rounded professional I am today. I wouldn't trade that experience for anything. However, I knew from the start, my destination was beyond the consulting corporate ladder. In May of 2019, I
											decided to leave my consulting gig and pursue the technology entrepreneurship journey. Within a month, I was up and running my new company, First Eagle Inc. In July, as the sole employee of my firm, I partnered with a larger firm and successfully delivered my first project to
											my client, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services.
